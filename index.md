---

I am currently Director of <a href="https://data.4tu.nl/" target="_blank">4TU.ResearchData</a>, an international data repository for science, engineering and design, based in the Netherlands. 

I have a background in open science and research data across a range of national and institutional contexts, including working in Ireland on national policy and coordination as National Open Research Coordinator, and positions in Germany and Australia supporting open science in European projects and academic libraries. 

My research background is in musicology, digital humanities and information management.
