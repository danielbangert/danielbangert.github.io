I am currently the Scholarly Communications Librarian at <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/" target="_blank">UNSW Sydney</a>. In this role I support academics to share and publish their research. I hold qualifications in information management, music performance and musicology, including a PhD from UNSW Sydney. 

If you would like to talk about scholarly communication or are interested in collaborating on a project, please <a href="mailto:d.bangert@unsw.edu.au">email me</a>.
