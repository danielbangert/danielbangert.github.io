I am currently the Scholarly Communications Librarian at UNSW Sydney. I support academics to share and publish their research. My interests include open access, research data management, metadata and digital scholarship. 

I hold qualifications in music performance, musicology and information management, including a PhD from UNSW Sydney. I have presented and published on topics including persistent identifiers, data publication workflows, linked data for jazz research, music psychology and Baroque performance practice. 

If you would like to talk about scholarly communication or are interested in collaborating on a project, please contact me via email or Twitter.
